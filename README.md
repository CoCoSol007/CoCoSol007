My name is CoCoSol and I am a 16-year-old French coder with a strong desire to learn. Despite my limited experience, I am passionate about development and mathematics. Currently, I am a student at Caousou in France and I am always seeking new challenges. To contact me or ask any questions, please email me at contact@cocosol.fr.

I am fluent in French and am learning Esperanto and English.
